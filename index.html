    <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> Hallie Geary is a sophomore studying Information Science. She grew up in La Crosse, 
            Wisconsin enjoying different community events, including the La Crosse Summer Reading 
            Program Summer Reading | La Crosse Public Library, Oktoberfest Das Beste - Oktoberfest U.S.A. - 
            La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Rotary Lights Home Page For La Crosse Rotary LIghts Holiday Display. She 
            is interested in becoming a librarian and using the skills of the information world as part 
            of her future career, and this class in particular would allow her to learn more on 
            coding and intersectionality! Currently, she is working at the Choir Library in 
            the School of Music and gaining experience in cataloging, 
            file migration/management, distribution/collection, and more. (FIXME HALLIE SOME ARE SUPPOSED TO BE LINKS) </p>
    <h2>Implicit Bias</h2>
        <h3>Understanding Intersectionality:</h3>
            <p>Intersectionality is a way of understanding the difference between different groups of people 
                and how their experiences may differ. One way to think about it as several roads that a group 
                of people might lie on, and intersectionality is about analyzing the crossroads of those roads 
                to understand levels of power, discrimination, and how people’s experiences 
                or opportunities may differ.</p>
        <h3>Understanding Implicit Bias:</h3>
            <p>Bias is seen in many different ways, but implicit bias is the ways that inner biases people 
                may hold affect their behavior towards different groups (usually) unconsciously, upholding 
                harmful stereotypes. There has been many tests to identify what biases individuals may hold, 
                but one of the more reputable comes from Harvard (add link)</p>
    <h2>Tech Hero</h2>
        <p>Issra Omer is an inspiration and great leading figure in tech. Currently a Product Director at Spotify, 
            she has gone to work on many of the newer features available on Spotify today, including the updates to the ‘Now Playing’ and ‘Lyrics’ feature. 
            She has been in the field for a decade, working at Meta before starting her career at Spotify 7 years ago. She has been interviewed and 
            hosted workshops about her career and some of her experiences, which is one of the reasons we chose her to be one of our tech 
            heroes. 
        After receiving her B.S. of Product Design Engineering, she volunteered at the organization “Girls Who Code” 
            (add link). This organization has helped many girls who may have previously felt excluded from the coding 
            space enter it with open minds and fun, exciting projects they could begin to tackle. 
        One of the other specific 
            ways she spoke to us were some of her interviews. Through them we get a real grasp of her character and her 
            amazing skills while she was still a Principal Product Manager. The first was her admitting to previous faults 
            she had made of being too involved in the specific workings of a project, and learning to allow for structure 
            without becoming overbearing to those who have expertise on what is being developed. The other metaphor I 
            enjoyed was her fire metaphor, being that you need to spread out your ‘firefighters’ and let small 
            fires burn while getting the larger ones under control.

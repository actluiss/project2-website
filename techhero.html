    <h3>Issra Omer</h3>
    <div class="techHero">
      <p>
        Issra Omer is an inspiration and great leading figure in tech. Currently a
        Product Director at Spotify, she has gone to work on many of the newer
        features available on Spotify today, including the updates to the Now
        Playing and Lyrics feature. She has been in the field for a decade,
        working at Meta before starting her career at Spotify 7 years ago. She has
        been interviewed and hosted workshops about her career and some of her
        experiences, which is one of the reasons we chose her to be one of our
        tech heroes. After receiving her B.S. of Product Design Engineering, she
        volunteered at the organization <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>. This
        organization has helped many girls who may have previously felt excluded
        from the coding space enter it with open minds and fun, exciting projects
        they could begin to tackle. One of the other specific ways she spoke to us
        were some of her interviews. Through them we get a real grasp of her
        character and her amazing skills while she was still a Principal Product
        Manager. The first was her admitting to previous faults she had made of
        being too involved in the specific workings of a project, and learning to
        allow for structure without becoming overbearing to those who have
        expertise on what is being developed. The other metaphor I enjoyed was her
        fire metaphor, being that you need to spread out your firefighters and let
        small fires burn while getting the larger ones under control.

    <h3>David Rodriguez</h3>
    <div class="techHero">
      <p>
        David Rodriguez is an outgoing software developer and businessman who has
        promoted diversity and inclusion in the tech industry while making
        important contributions to mobile technology. After spending endless hours
        reading books and creating his own games and simulations, he discovered
        programming when he was thirteen years old. Encouraged by his parents'
        emphasis on education and a helpful high school teacher, David attended
        the New Jersey Institute of Technology to earn a degree in Computer
        Engineering. There, he managed projects like automating a Chevy Blazer for
        the DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges, which further solidified his desire
        to work in technology that has the potential to change many lives. After
        graduating, David worked on mobile technology and co-founded Forge42 after
        realizing that success in the tech industry necessitates not only coding
        expertise but also understanding of product development, business, and
        marketing. Being a first-generation Ecuadorian immigrant, he has
        experienced the difficulties that people of color encounter in the United
        States and has pushed for more resources and assistance for POC pursuing
        careers in technology. David encourages students to begin coding early and
        work on side projects, emphasizing lifelong learning, flexibility, and
        mentoring.

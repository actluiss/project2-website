      Hi, my name is Luis Mendez, I am a senior majoring in Data Science and
      Information Science with a certificate in digital stuides. I am from
      Chicago IL. I enjoy learning about technology and how it can be used to
      solve real-world problems. A few things I like to do is shopping,
      listening to music, playing video games, and going on walks. In the
      future, I plan to pursue a career as a data analyst or data scientist. My
      goal is to use data to find important trends, support decision-making, and
      assist businesses in resolving issues. This course is helping me build
      important skills in web development and data presentation, which will be
      valuable for sharing insights and communicating findings effectively in a
      professional setting.

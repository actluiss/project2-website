    <h1>Resources on Implicit Bias and Intersectionality</h1>

    <h2>IBT</h2>
    <div class="resources">
      <p>
        When taking the Implicit Bias Test, we noticed that the exercises were
        more focused on quick reactions than on consciously thinking about the
        words or images themselves. The fact that the test evaluated our
        instinctive reactions rather than our conscious judgments was interesting.
        We found that sometimes the challenge wasn't understanding the content but
        simply keeping up with the speed required to match categories correctly.
        The IBT, however, helped us understand the implicit associations we may
        have and emphasized the significance of being conscious of these
        unintentional bias when making decisions in daily life.

        Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how different aspects
        of a person's identity, such as race, gender, class, sexual orientation,
        or disability, intersect and influence their experiences in society. One
        way to think about it is as several roads that a group of people might lie
        on, and intersectionality analyzes the crossroads of those roads to
        understand levels of power, discrimination, and how people's opportunities
        or experiences may differ. This approach helps highlight how systemic
        inequalities affect people differently, depending on their unique
        combination of identities.

    <h2>Implicit bias</h2>
    <div class="resources">
      <p>
        Implicit bias, which can take many different forms, is the term used to
        describe the attitudes or stereotypes people may unknowingly hold that
        affect how they perceive, behave, and make decisions regarding different
        groups, frequently reinforcing negative stereotypes. Even when individuals
        consciously believe in equality, these hidden biases can affect behavior.
        Recognizing implicit bias is the first step toward challenging assumptions
        and creating more inclusive environments.
